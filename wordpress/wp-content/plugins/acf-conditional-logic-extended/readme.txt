Display Field Group based on a field value from another group.

== Description ==
Extend your Group Field conditional logic with extra set of rules and select field value as your condition.

Supported fields:
 - text
 - textarea
 - range
 - url
 - number
 - select
 - post object

A good use case is if you have multiple Field Groups displayed in the same location, but youâ€™d like one of them to be visible only if the condition from the other group is satisfied.
It works well with [ACF Custom Database Tables](https://hookturn.io/downloads/acf-custom-database-tables/) from Hookturn, where you might want to split one large Field Group into multiple smaller and have an organized DB.

== Installation ==
1. Download and activate the plugin.
2. Make sure you are using the Advanced Custom Fields plugin
3. Edit or create a new Field Group
4. Enable Group Conditional Logic and set your rules
